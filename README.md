## Complete the application

We're going to create an application for a pet adoption agency.
This agency has dogs and cats that need a good home!
Users will be able to select a dog or a cat from a dropdown list and see a preview of the selected dog or cat.
They will be able to select that pet for adoption by clicking a button.
The pet they've selected for adoption will then appear at the very top of the app!
